That is going to leave a mark if you forced Smith into your lineup for the final week of the fantasy regular season. There wasn't much Smith could do against a swarming Cowboys defense on an evening where Drew Brees completed just 18 passes for 127 yards.

He recorded eight catches on nine targets in the first half, but he managed just 39 yards on those grabs. All of that changed in a flash in the third quarter. With the Steelers backed up against their own goal line, Smith-Schuster got loose down the sideline, Ben Roethlisberger was able to find him despite taking a hit, and the receiver out-ran everyone for a 97-yard touchdown. Amazingly, it is the second 97-yard catch of Smith-Schuster’s career, both the longest passing plays in Steelers’ history, and he also scored a 96-yard kickoff return last season. Smith-Schuster did not pack it in after that grab. With the game on the line late in the fourth, Smith-Schuster caught two 19-yard passes to help get the Steelers in position for the win -- a Roethlisberger interception ended the comeback. Smith-Schuster faces a tough matchup next week against the Chargers, but he will remain a high-end WR2.",JuJu Smith-Schuster hauled in 13-of-17 targets for 189 yards and a touchdown in the Steelers' Week 12 loss to the Broncos.,,,Steelers,http://www.rotoworld.com/recent/nfl/12184/juju-smith-schuster
