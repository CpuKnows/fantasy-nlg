Unfortunately for San Francisco, he could not build on that drive in the second half, and he tossed another interception on a pass thrown slightly behind Kittle in the third quarter.

Beckham shrugged off those mistakes later in the first half when he unfurled a 57-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Saquon Barkley.

2018-09-09 16:31:00,"Allen replaced a faceplanting Nathan Peterman in the third quarter. It wasn't much of a debut, but he moved the offense better than Peterman. Allen should've had a touchdown that was dropped by Kelvin Benjamin in the end-zone. The Bills are likely to continue to go with Allen as their starter going forward. He'll get a tough test in the Chargers in Week 2.",Josh Allen,QB,Josh Allen completed 6-of-15 passes for 74 yards in Buffalo's Week 1 game against Baltimore.,,,Bills,http://www.rotoworld.com/recent/nfl/13045/josh-allen,13045
2018-09-16 16:21:00,"Allen moved the offense better than Nathan Peterman, but there were some rough stretches in his first start. He didn't get much help from an offense that allowed five sacks, but Allen held on to the ball too long at times and made some reckless throws, resulting in the two picks. Allen showed off his arm on a 57-yard bomb to Zay Jones, and his garbage-time touchdown to Kelvin Benjamin was threaded in a tight window. The Bills are committed to Allen as their starter for the rest of the year. He'll get another tough matchup with the Vikings in Week 3.",Josh Allen,QB,Josh Allen completed 18-of-33 passes for 245 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions in Sunday's Week 2 loss to the Chargers.,,,Bills,http://www.rotoworld.com/recent/nfl/13045/josh-allen,13045
2018-09-23 16:26:00,"Despite dealing with constant pressure throughout the afternoon, Allen made play after play with both his arm and legs in Buffalo's dominating win over Minnesota. The Bills' trenches did little to help Allen, but the No. 7 overall pick's ability to scramble and throw on the run allowed him to extend plays outside of the pocket and consistently find open receivers in the flats. Allen has quietly become Buffalo's red zone back, scoring two touchdowns inside the 10-yard line on Sunday. Allen and the Bills travel to Lambeau Field to face the Packers in Week 4.",Josh Allen,QB,"Josh Allen completed 15-of-22 passes for 196 yards and one touchdown, adding 10 carries for 39 yards and two touchdowns on the ground in the Bills' Week 3 victory over the Vikings.",,,Bills,http://www.rotoworld.com/recent/nfl/13045/josh-allen,13045
2018-09-30 16:19:00,"Everything the Bills were in Week 3 against the Vikings, that's what they weren't today. Allen entered halftime just 5-of-19 for 58 yards and a pick. He was scarcely better after the break, where he specialized in taking thundering sacks as he spun backwards. His picks were amateur hour decisions. This kind of wild inconsistency is going to be Allen's hallmark as he gets his NFL sea legs amidst scarily-little surrounding talent in Buffalo. He will not be a recommended streamer against the Titans' upstart defense in Week 5.",Josh Allen,QB,"Josh Allen completed 16-of-33 passes for 151 yards, zero touchdowns and two interceptions in the Bills' 22-0, Week 4 loss to the Packers, also losing a fumble and taking seven sacks.",,,Bills,http://www.rotoworld.com/recent/nfl/13045/josh-allen,13045
2018-10-07 15:59:00,"Buffalo pulled this upset without any hint of a passing game, instead relying on Allen's 14-yard rushing touchdown on their opening drive and two Steven Hauschka field goals, including the 46-yard game winner as time expired.  The Bills are now a surprising 2-3 after upset victories over Tennessee and Minnesota.  Allen will remain a high-variance QB2 when Buffalo visits Houston next.",Josh Allen,QB,"Josh Allen completed 10-of-19 passes for 82 yards and an interception in the Bills' Week 5 win over the Titans, 13-12.",,,Bills,http://www.rotoworld.com/recent/nfl/13045/josh-allen,13045
2018-10-14 15:10:00,"Allen took a big hit to his elbow when was sandwiched between two defenders as he delivered a deep pass to Kelvin Benjamin in the third quarter. He stayed in for another play, but he grabbed his throwing arm after that throw and headed to the sideline. He is officially questionable to return, but he has a big wrap on his elbow which suggests his day is over. Nathan Peterman has taken over.",Josh Allen,QB,Josh Allen exited Week 6 against the Texans with a right elbow injury.,,,Bills,http://www.rotoworld.com/recent/nfl/13045/josh-allen,13045
2018-09-30 00:01:00,"McCoy was limited in practice throughout the week but remained insistent he would play. Although all signs point to him suiting up, his floor is no longer what it used to be, especially on the road in this matchup against the Packers that could lead to a negative game script for the Bills' rushing attack. Josh Allen is the only skill player worth starting for Buffalo, and even that's a stretch at Lambeau Field. It's best to avoid this offense altogether in Week 4.",LeSean McCoy,RB,LeSean McCoy (ribs) is expected to play in Week 4 against the Packers.,https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1046247837938438144,Adam Schefter on Twitter,Bills,http://www.rotoworld.com/recent/nfl/5168/lesean-mccoy,5168
2018-09-30 11:31:00,"McCoy will be a boom/bust RB2/3 against the Pack. Change-of-pace backup Marcus Murphy is sidelined, meaning Chris Ivory should see plenty of run behind McCoy.

2018-09-30 17:19:00,"McCoy has now been held below 10 touches in 2-of-3 games and has handled the ball only 29 times all season. Speaking afterward, McCoy said ""the plan was to get me the ball,"" and that he had no explanation for his light usage. The scoreboard was a major problem — the Bills were trailing all afternoon — but McCoy is more than capable of catching the ball, and change-of-pace Marcus Murphy was inactive. The Bills' Josh Allen-led offense is proving catastrophic for McCoy's fantasy value. He will be a high-risk FLEX option in Week 5 against the Titans' upstart defense.",LeSean McCoy,RB,"LeSean McCoy rushed five times for 24 yards in the Bills' Week 4 loss to the Packers, adding three receptions for 13 additional yards.",,,Bills,http://www.rotoworld.com/recent/nfl/5168/lesean-mccoy,5168
2018-10-07 16:13:00,"And it felt like a career game for McCoy after how poorly he started the season.  McCoy's 26 touches and 108 total yards were both easily year highs on a Bills offense that has struggled to function week to week.  Nevertheless, McCoy showed juice on several chunk-yardage gains and clearly has plenty left in his tank.  He will remain a risky RB2/flex option in Week 6 at Houston.",LeSean McCoy,RB,LeSean McCoy rushed 24 times for 85 yards and caught 2-of-3 targets for 23 yards in the Bills' Week 5 win over the Titans.,,,Bills,http://www.rotoworld.com/recent/nfl/5168/lesean-mccoy,5168
2018-10-14 08:26:00,"The running-back-needy Eagles placed a call to Buffalo this week but those talks didn't get very far. McCoy has history with Philadelphia—it's where he started his career—but he's well-liked in the Bills' locker room and Buffalo values his veteran leadership. Per Rapoport, it would likely take a second-rounder and more to pry McCoy away from Western New York, which the Eagles rightly feel is an exorbitant asking price. The 10-year vet is under contract through 2019.",LeSean McCoy,RB,NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reports the Bills are unlikely to trade LeSean McCoy.,http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000973199/article/bills-unlikely-to-trade-lesean-mccoy-to-eagles?campaign=Twitter_atn,NFL.com,Bills,http://www.rotoworld.com/recent/nfl/5168/lesean-mccoy,5168
2018-10-14 17:07:00,"Aside from Josh Allen scrambles and a random Nathan Peterman touchdown, McCoy was the Bills' offense in this one. He started his day with a 22-yard catch on an ill-advised throw from Allen, and he consistently made things happen in the running game. Unfortunately, it was not enough for the Bills to score more than 13 points. Volume will hopefully keep McCoy in the FLEX range all season, but touchdowns will be difficult to find, assuming he is not traded.",LeSean McCoy,RB,LeSean McCoy rushed 16 times for 73 yards and hauled in 3-of-5 targets for 21 yards in the Bills' Week 6 loss to the Texans.,,,Bills,http://www.rotoworld.com/recent/nfl/5168/lesean-mccoy,5168
