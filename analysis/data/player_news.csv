One of those fumbles was returned for a 23-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter, which essentially sealed the victory for Arizona. The 24-year-old benefited from garbage time, logging over 200 passing yards with San Francisco trailing in the second half. His lone rushing score came on a one-yard QB sneak.

He threw 67- and 30-yard touchdowns to Marquise Goodwin, who roasted Kentrell Brice and Tramon Williams on each.

Unfortunately for San Francisco, he could not build on that drive in the second half, and he tossed another interception on a pass thrown slightly behind Kittle in the third quarter.

That said, he probably deserved at least two interceptions and got lucky on several throws.

Even Taylor Gabriel was involved in Chicago's efforts Sunday, recording a career-high 104 receiving yards and two scores.

The scrambles eventually dried up, however, and Trubisky struggled to get anything going down the field. His risky throws caught up to him on an interception near the end of the third quarter, and he was picked again early in the fourth on an underthrown pass.
