That said, he probably deserved at least two interceptions and got lucky on several throws.

Even a critical late completion to Christian Kirk to set up a touchdown should have been intercepted. Rosen's biggest play was a 59-yard screen score where Kirk did all the work.

He did push the ball down the field later in the game, finding Josh Gordon with a tight-window pass for 20 yards on the final play of the first quarter and then hitting the receiver again for a fourth-down conversion. He found Gordon again for a 55-yard gain in the second half to set up his third touchdown. Brady now has three touchdowns in three of his last four games, and he has topped 300 yards in two of those.

Beckham shrugged off those mistakes later in the first half when he unfurled a 57-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Saquon Barkley. That stands as the Giants' longest pass play of the season through five games. Odell added another touchdown in the fourth quarter, beating James Bradberry on a 33-yard deep heave by Eli Manning. In doing so, Beckham became the first Giant to both throw and catch a touchdown pass in the same game since Hall of Famer Frank Gifford in 1959.

Speaking after the game, coach Pat Shurmur claimed Beckham needed an IV. Beckham was amongst the last out of the locker room for the second half, and was soon spotted screaming at a cooling machine. The reason for his frustration was evident to anyone watching the game. Eli Manning simply could not get him the ball on anything but the shortest of passes.

2018-09-30 17:19:00,"McCoy has now been held below 10 touches in 2-of-3 games and has handled the ball only 29 times all season. Speaking afterward, McCoy said ""the plan was to get me the ball,"" and that he had no explanation for his light usage. The scoreboard was a major problem — the Bills were trailing all afternoon — but McCoy is more than capable of catching the ball, and change-of-pace Marcus Murphy was inactive. The Bills' Josh Allen-led offense is proving catastrophic for McCoy's fantasy value. He will be a high-risk FLEX option in Week 5 against the Titans' upstart defense.",LeSean McCoy,RB,"LeSean McCoy rushed five times for 24 yards in the Bills' Week 4 loss to the Packers, adding three receptions for 13 additional yards.",,,Bills,http://www.rotoworld.com/recent/nfl/5168/lesean-mccoy,5168
2018-10-07 16:13:00,"And it felt like a career game for McCoy after how poorly he started the season.  McCoy's 26 touches and 108 total yards were both easily year highs on a Bills offense that has struggled to function week to week.  Nevertheless, McCoy showed juice on several chunk-yardage gains and clearly has plenty left in his tank.  He will remain a risky RB2/flex option in Week 6 at Houston.",LeSean McCoy,RB,LeSean McCoy rushed 24 times for 85 yards and caught 2-of-3 targets for 23 yards in the Bills' Week 5 win over the Titans.,,,Bills,http://www.rotoworld.com/recent/nfl/5168/lesean-mccoy,5168
2018-10-09 12:31:00,"This move would make a lot of sense. In the middle of a rebuild, the Bills do not need to pay a 30-year-old running back for the next two seasons, but it makes a lot of sense for an Eagles squad which is in the middle of their championship window and just lost Jay Ajayi to a torn ACL. McCoy did not leave Philly on the best terms way back in 2015, but Chip Kelly is long gone. Although it could take him some time to settle in, McCoy's fantasy value would get a big boost if he is traded to the Eagles...or really anywhere else.",LeSean McCoy,RB,"WIVB Buffalo's Josh Reed reports the Eagles have ""reached out"" to the Bills about acquiring LeSean McCoy.",https://twitter.com/4JoshReed/status/1049692368985907200,Josh Reed on Twitter,Bills,http://www.rotoworld.com/recent/nfl/5168/lesean-mccoy,5168

I won’t get into any more detail than that.  LeSean is a valuable member of our football team and we'll leave it at that.""  McDermott downplays the swirling rumors that popped up Tuesday, but did not shoot them down completely.

2018-10-14 08:26:00,"The running-back-needy Eagles placed a call to Buffalo this week but those talks didn't get very far. McCoy has history with Philadelphia—it's where he started his career—but he's well-liked in the Bills' locker room and Buffalo values his veteran leadership. Per Rapoport, it would likely take a second-rounder and more to pry McCoy away from Western New York, which the Eagles rightly feel is an exorbitant asking price. The 10-year vet is under contract through 2019.",LeSean McCoy,RB,NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reports the Bills are unlikely to trade LeSean McCoy.,http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000973199/article/bills-unlikely-to-trade-lesean-mccoy-to-eagles?campaign=Twitter_atn,NFL.com,Bills,http://www.rotoworld.com/recent/nfl/5168/lesean-mccoy,5168
2018-10-14 17:07:00,"Aside from Josh Allen scrambles and a random Nathan Peterman touchdown, McCoy was the Bills' offense in this one. He started his day with a 22-yard catch on an ill-advised throw from Allen, and he consistently made things happen in the running game. Unfortunately, it was not enough for the Bills to score more than 13 points. Volume will hopefully keep McCoy in the FLEX range all season, but touchdowns will be difficult to find, assuming he is not traded.",LeSean McCoy,RB,LeSean McCoy rushed 16 times for 73 yards and hauled in 3-of-5 targets for 21 yards in the Bills' Week 6 loss to the Texans.,,,Bills,http://www.rotoworld.com/recent/nfl/5168/lesean-mccoy,5168
2018-10-21 13:22:00,"It's surprising that the Bills are checking him for a concussion as McCoy appeared to injure his right leg/ankle after being tackled out of bounds by Kenny Moore on Buffalo's opening drive. McCoy went to the locker room, where he'll presumably go through concussion testing. Chris Ivory will fill in at running back for Buffalo.",LeSean McCoy,RB,LeSean McCoy left Sunday's Week 7 game against the Colts and is being evaluated for a head injury.,https://twitter.com/BuffaloBillsPR/status/1054059326992728066,Buffalo Bills PR on Twitter,Bills,http://www.rotoworld.com/recent/nfl/5168/lesean-mccoy,5168

He's still on track to play (and get cleared) assuming another limited session on Saturday.
